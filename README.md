COGS121 Facebook Twitter API Application 
Part 2 - A D3JS Visualization of Your Facebook Friend Network
===========

Instructions
=====================
1.  Run npm install.
2.  Set all api keys in .env file. (make sure the callback urls are set correctly depending on dev or prod)
3.  Run on localhost. (the visualization is located at /d3graph, will need to authenticate first to access page)

Alternatively, view the application in deployment at http://fbforcegraph.herokuapp.com/


Design Principles
====================
Two examples of design principles utilized can be seen in 
- Feedback: the loading ajax spinner while the graph is being generated by D3JS on the facebook visualization page
- Mapping: the pause button allows us to pause generation of the graph, giving the user a good mapping between this control and the resulting effect allows in greater ease of use. we colored the pause button red as people often associate the word red with STOP.

We opted to use a force graph to display Closeness Centrality as our Social Network Analysis parameter.



Misc Notes
=======================
When running facebook app within the canvas(within facebook), application will automatically authenticate and route to facebok data page.
Authentication for Twitter and Facebook pages in the Navbar will not work due to SAMEORIGIN policy and canvas authentication for Facebook.
